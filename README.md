# Installation


[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install git (preferably, version >= 2.0) and python (preferably, version >=3.6)
 [(windows)](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-git-bash-on-windows/)
 For Linux :
 ```bash
    sudo yum instal git -y
    sudo yum install python -y
 ```
 
2. Copy the github url from the repository : 

 ```bash
 https://github.com/SiddharthaShandilya/automation-using-python.git
 ```

3. Select a Directory in local system and use 

  ```bash 
  git clonehttps://github.com/SiddharthaShandilya/automation-using-python.git           
  ```

    *Note for `git clone command`  Please make sure that you have proper internet connection. *

    *Note for `python` Please try to anaconda for running the app.*  

4. Create a seperate virtual environment to avoid conflict between python libraries :
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv new-env 
    ```

5. Activate the virtual env: ðŸ‘‰ [(click Here)](https://www.programshelp.com/help/python/activate_virtual_environment_python_windows_10.html)
6. Install all the libraries as well as software for the application.Do download Docker, Hadoop, AWS.

6. Have a look at [Recommended configurations](#recommended-configurations) and [Custom configurations](#custom-configurations).

# Recommended configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Update yum/dnf repository for downloading the required software.

```bash
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```
2. After Downloading the repo update it.

 ```sh 
 sudo dnf update
```
3. Install Docker : ```bash sudo dnf install docker ```


4. Install java-8: ```sh dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk ant -y ```

5. Install Hadoop. For more reference ðŸ‘‰[click here](https://tecadmin.net/install-hadoop-centos-8/)

```sh
sudo wget http://apachemirror.wuchna.com/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.2.1/hadoop-3.2.1.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hadoop-3.2.1.tar.gz
```
6. Install aws-cli: ```sh sudo dnf install awscli  ```


# Custom configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


you can overwrtite the existng codes and add new features. 

In order to add new features in the application you need to:

ðŸ“Œcreate a seperate file where you can store all the neccessary configuration code.

ðŸ“ŒMake sure to put every task in seperate function.

ðŸ“ŒImport the new file name to main.py: ``` import <new-file-name> ```.

# Uninstallation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Want to uninstall and revert back to the old style? No issues (sob). Please feel free to open an issue regarding how we can enhance `automation-using-python app`.

```sh
rmdir ./automation-using-python
```
